## Coding and Design Guidelines
- Include inline comments in the code to explain what each section does
- Since I am vibe coding, it will be atleast helpful what each section of code does so that I confidently modify in future
- Whenever suggesting new code, make sure it is always on top of the latest code. Ask, if you dont have latest code files
- Regression: Strictly avoid taking away features or capabilities while suggesting new code or without informing me
- Generate a Design diagram and the Tech Stack for this feature

## UI Design Guidelines
- I like the Tiles a.k.a cards approach, looks neat and slick
- home page can start with a bunch of tiles - Volunteers, Events, Resources, etc.
- The title "Youth Services IMS" should be a banner that is visible in all pages
- Breadcrumbs can indicate which page the user is on
- The logout button can be on the top right
- Bottom most section can be a list of links to various resources
	- link to Yogoda Satsanga Society of India home page
	- Home page of this portal
- Pagination or a lazy load wherever the UI has more than a page to display
  

## üìã CSV Template: Event Attendance

#```
#eventName,eventDate,volunteerName,status,remarks
#Online Teen Satsanga,01-11-2025,Ajay Madan,Present,‚Äî
#```

## üß± New Module Ideas

- Departments need to be created. The department values are
	- Communications & Outreach
	- Volunteer coordination
	- Programs & Operations
	- YS Support for Centers,Online
	- Training & Content

- There are many roles, that are mapped to department. Following are the entries for Roles:
	Role Name
	Role Category 	
	Roles & Responsibilities (string)	
	Preferred Skills (independent tags that allows multi-select & search)	
	Time commitment needed (days per week)	
	Comments (string)

- On the Volunteers page, right on top display a summary of all Volunteers and show a breakup side by side count of men & women 
- A form with relevant fields to add a new volunteer
- A page to enumerate all relevant skills of volunteers, this is like a master database of skills
- Role Based Access (Administrator, Portal user, YS Core Member)
- An API look up to the Parent Organization (Yogoda Satsanga Society of India) IT system to look up lesson number based on phone number
- An API look up to the Parent Organization (Yogoda Satsanga Society of India) IT system to look up phone number based on lesson number 
- Like Skills, maintain a Roles Database that can be assigned to different volunteers like the following - 
	- Facilitator
	- Asst. Facilitator
	- Trainer
	- Group Discussion Leader
	- Group Leader
	- Writer 
	- IT Ops
- Document Hub
	- Shows most used and important documents like vision statements, organization structure
	- Links to Google Drive to show document navigator and ability to search for documents
- Ambitious Goal: Ability for each volunteer to come to this portal to get information they need and use it as a self-serve portal
