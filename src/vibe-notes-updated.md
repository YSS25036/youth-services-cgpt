## Coding and Design Guidelines
- Include inline comments in the code to explain what each section does
- Since I am vibe coding, it will be atleast helpful what each section of code does so that I confidently modify in future
- Whenever suggesting new code, make sure it is always on top of the latest code. Ask, if you dont have latest code files
- Regression: Strictly avoid taking away features or capabilities while suggesting new code or without informing me
- Generate a Design diagram and the Tech Stack for this feature

## UI Design Guidelines
- I like the Tiles a.k.a cards approach, looks neat and slick
- home page can start with a bunch of tiles - Volunteers, Events, Resources, etc.
- The title "Youth Services IMS" should be a banner that is visible in all pages
- Breadcrumbs can indicate which page the user is on
- The logout button can be on the top right
- Bottom most section can be a list of links to various resources
	- link to Yogoda Satsanga Society of India home page
	- Home page of this portal
- Pagination or a lazy load wherever the UI has more than a page to display
  

## üìã CSV Template: Event Attendance
